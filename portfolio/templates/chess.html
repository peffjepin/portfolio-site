    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>This is an application I wrote as a simple, playable demo for gamelib. It
    is a chess desktop application which allows you to pick a side and play
    against the computer.</p>

    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <h3>Rendering</h3>
    <p>All rendering is done with OpenGL. The related code is mostly located within the
    <a href="https://github.com/peffjepin/gamelib-chess/blob/master/chess/scenes.py", target="_blank">scenes.py</a> file.</p>
    <p>The board is just a transformed cube. It is 9x9 world units, allowing for the
    small visual edge to the board. This creates a convenient coordinate system
    for the board squares. If we consider the c2 square for instance, it works
    out that the Transform position for a piece on this square would have
    <em>x=3</em> for <em>c</em> and <em>y=2</em> for <em>2</em>.</p>
    <p>The pieces are 3d models loaded from .obj files. Gamelib handles locating
    and loading these resources and others such as the textures automatically.</p>

    <h3>Game Logic</h3>
    <p>The chess logic can be found in
    <a href="https://github.com/peffjepin/gamelib-chess/blob/master/chess/model.py" target="_blank">model.py</a>,
    while a lot of user input related logic is found in <a href="https://github.com/peffjepin/gamelib-chess/blob/master/chess/scenes.py" target="_blank">scenes.py.</a></p>
    <p>The main logic we are concerned with is determining if a move is legal or
    not. At first it seems that there would be many different edge cases to check
    for involving chess tactics. But really if we assume that all prior moves leading
    up to a position have been legal, then we only really care about one thing:
    Is our king in check after we've finished our turn?</p>
    <p>Using this logic we can easily determine if a move is legal like so:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the move</li>
        <li>Determine if we are in check</li>
        <li>If we are not in check, the move is legal.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The primary end condition, checkmate, is easy to check for with this
    implementation as well. If a move puts an opponent in check, we simply need
    to determine if the player in check has any legal moves (which we already
    know how to do).</p>
    <p>I won't go into edge cases, but the application handles castling,
    en-passent, stalemate, drawn-by-repetition, and insufficient-material. See
    the source code if you're interested in those cases.</p>

    <h3>The Opponent</h3>
    <p>The game uses
    <a href="https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish" target="_blank">stockfish</a>
    to compute moves for the opponent to play. To accomplish this, I wrote a
    <a href="https://github.com/peffjepin/gamelib-chess/blob/master/chess/stockfish.py" target="_blank">barebones stockfish binding.</a>
    Stockfish binaries for Windows and Linux are both included in the repo.</p>
    <p>Since my stockfish binding is only programmed to select the <em>best</em> move,
    raise the depth/elo variables at your own peril.</p>
    <p>There is also a debug opponent which lets the user play both sides. Launch
    the program with the <strong><em>-d</em></strong> command line flag for this 
    opponent.</p>
